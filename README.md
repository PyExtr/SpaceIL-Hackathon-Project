# SpaceIL Hackathon Project: 3D Spacecraft Visualization

Welcome to our SpaceIL Hackathon project, a testament to rapid learning, teamwork, and a passion for solving challenges. Our team endeavored to create a 3D interactive visualization of a spacecraft in real-time, utilizing actual data from the first Beresheet mission and the relative moon position.

## Project Journey

The journey of this project was as exciting as it was challenging. Initially, we attempted to create the visualization using three.js. However, after several attempts and with the clock ticking, we decided to switch gears and embrace Unity for our development. This decision came with its own set of challenges as none of our team members had prior knowledge or experience with Unity or C#. But, driven by our determination, we succeeded in creating a functional prototype of our vision.

## Learning Experience

This project offered us the opportunity to explore several new technologies. It was an enriching experience to immerse ourselves in a new development environment, and a new language, and to see our efforts materialize into a working product. Participating in a hackathon of this scale has been an incredible journey of learning and collaboration.
