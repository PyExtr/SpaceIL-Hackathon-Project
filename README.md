# SpaceIL-Hackathon-Project
I was part of an excellent team, and we took on the visualization challenge.
We began by attempting to build it out using three.js but after several attempts and with time running out we pivoted to Unity.
None of us had any prior knowledge or experience with this environment or with C#, but I am happy to say we nevertheless succeeded in producing a good working prototype. We used real-time data from the first Bereshit, and relative moon position, to visualize the 3d interactive positioning of the spacecraft.
I was exposed to several technologies that were completely new to me and it was an incredible experience to take part in a hackathon of this scale.

**The visualization is ready to play in "Build" folder, have fun seen the accurate trajectory of the Bereshit1 :)**
